            <p> I am an Alonquin College student, enrolled in Interactive Media Design. I am in this program for the reason that I am willing to learn more
                in this program on things that I did not know before. 
                <br> 
                Which at the end will extend my knowledge when it comes to web design and coding purposes.
            </p>

            <p> I had learned how to code from high school, then from my first program in college. I find that html is easier to understand. 
                So far this course is good, I am having a good time learning from my teacher.
                <br> 
                I cannot wait for the time that we will be far from where we are now.</p>
