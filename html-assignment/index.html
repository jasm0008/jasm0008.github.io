                I am an <em>Algonquin College</em> student, enrolled in <em>Interactive Media Design</em>. I am in this program for the reason that I am willing to learn more 
                in this program on things that I did not know before. 
                <br> 
                Which at the end will extend my knowledge when it comes to web design and coding purposes.
            </p>

            <p> I had learned how to code from high school, then from my first program in college. 
                I find that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is easier to understand. 
                So far this course is good, I am having a good time learning from my teacher.
                <br> 
                I cannot wait for the time that we will be far from where we are now.
