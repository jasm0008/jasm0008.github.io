        <p>Starfish are layered with an upper skin made out of calcium carbonate. This strong material makes the skin tough and difficult for hunters to breakdown.
        Some species of starfish will even go a step further with the addition of numerous spines on their skin, acting as a layer of armour to deter predators.
        Lacking a brain, blood and even a central nervous system, it might come as a surprise to you that starfish have eyes.
        Just to further add to their unusual anatomy, their eyes are on the end of their arms. Whilst their eyes may not be able to see in fine detail like our eyes can, 
        they are able to detect different shades of light allowing them to navigate their surroundings - allowing them to hunt for food and hide from predators. 
        Starfish are equipped with hundreds of tiny little feet at the end of each arm.
        To move, they fill these feet with seawater, causing the arm to move like a foot would. This mechanism allows the starfish to move - 
        much quicker than you might expect. Visit our rock pool to see this first hand!</p>
